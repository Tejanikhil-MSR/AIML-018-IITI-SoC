``` Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is crucial for overall well-being. This includes practicing good hygiene by washing hands frequently, especially during flu season. Additionally, it's essential to get enough sleep and reduce stress through activities like meditation, yoga, or simply taking a day off. A balanced diet, including regular breakfast consumption, can also help increase energy levels. Furthermore, staying physically active for at least 150 minutes per week can improve mental and physical health. It's also important to take care of your sexual health by practicing safe sex and getting vaccinated against common diseases like cervical cancer, cholera, diphtheria, and hepatitis. Breastfeeding is recommended within the first hour after birth, and breastfeeding for six months or more can help reduce the risk of breast and ovarian cancer. In addition, it's crucial to prevent mosquito-borne illnesses by wearing protective clothing, using insect repellent, and eliminating breeding sites. You can also take steps to prevent road accidents by following traffic rules, wearing helmets while riding motorcycles or bicycles, and not drinking and driving.
