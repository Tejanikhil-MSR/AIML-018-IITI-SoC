Rules&Regulations/Policies Applicants who have been provisionally selected are required to submit a copy of the original document at the career portal of the Institute by logging in with their registered address on or before March 30, 2025. Please ensure that the name and application reference number along with justification is mentioned in the covering letter. Failure to submit supporting documents would automatically place the applicant in the not-eligible category. Those who have a current employer's attestation also need to upload it at the recruitment portal where they had applied as ST category, however due to non-existence of vacancy in that particular category, the application has been considered under the Unreserved category subject to fulfillment of other criteria. The Scheme of the Examination and Syllabus is also available on the web page. A call will be made to eligible applicants only through registered email addresses. Applicants are advised to visit the Institute regularly for further updates from the Registrar.
