Here is the transformed text into a coherent paragraph while preserving all key details: The Department of Chemical Engineering offers several courses that focus on various aspects of processing, characterization, and energy conversion. In the Introduction to Soft Matter and Biopolymers course, students learn about the assembly of soft materials such as synthetic and biological systems, including their unique physicochemical properties. The Heat and Mass Transfer laboratory focuses on experimental measurement and understanding of heat transfer in various processes, including condensation, convection, and radiation. In the Characterization laboratory, students learn to determine crystal structure, hardness, mechanical properties, and microstructure of different materials. The Waste to Energy Conversion course covers production of energy from different types of waste through thermal, biological, and chemical processes, analyzing case studies for success and failure. Additionally, the department offers courses on thermodynamics, polymer chemistry, and molecular driving forces in biology, chemistry, and physics. The courses cover topics such as protein folding and crystallization, intrinsically disordered proteins, phase separation of polymers, and biological soft matter. Students also learn about colloidal systems, where physical, chemical, and biological principles intersect. The department's research focuses on the development of new materials and processes for energy conversion, waste management, and characterization. The faculty members are experts in their fields and provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the theoretical and practical aspects of processing, characterization, and energy conversion.
