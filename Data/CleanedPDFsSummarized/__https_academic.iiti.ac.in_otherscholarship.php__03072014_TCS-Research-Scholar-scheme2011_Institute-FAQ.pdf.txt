Here is the output: Others Our Research Fellowship Program, also known as the Research Scholar Scheme, has been open to applications since 2010. The program allows students to apply anytime up until the end of August, and we will consider applications until then. However, if our process for a batch is already over, we can only consider applications for the next batch. Students can even apply after their coursework is complete, as long as they are fresh admissions in the academic year. We recommend submitting preliminary applications with an area supervisor stated to the best possible extent now, allowing for flexibility to change later. There is no limit to the number of students from an institute that can apply, although we do have 40 available slots for the year and are inviting 80-100 top applicants in this cycle.
