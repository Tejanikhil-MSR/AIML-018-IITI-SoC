Here is a coherent paragraph that preserves all key details: The positions reserved exclusively for [category only] are advertised. The requirement is to have not less than [X] years of relevant experience as Junior Assistant in Pay Level as per Grade Pay of 2000 or equivalent post in the relevant field. However, many applicants failed to provide the latest valid certificate in the Central Government format, No Objection Certificate Vigilance Clearance Certificate from the current employer, and Experience Certificate is not attached. Not only that, but also, some candidates could not produce a detailed experience certificate as in the application is not available. Furthermore, there are instances where applicants did not provide a Valid certificate in the Central Government format and the relevant supporting document for their experience. As a result, these applications were deemed incomplete and will be rejected. Please note that this paragraph aims to condense the key details while maintaining clarity. However, if you would like me to make any adjustments or rephrase certain sections, please let me know!
