Here is a coherent paragraph summarizing the provided text: The University Institute of Technology Amendment Act, 2012 makes changes to the University Institute of Technology. The Board of the Institute will consist of the Vice-Chairman, nominated by the Executive Council, and four Vice-Chancellors, with two nominated by the Executive Council. The Academic Council and Senate will continue to function until new Boards are constituted under this Act. The University will strive to meet the technological needs of the state and union by supporting technical education in its zone. Students who have not completed their courses or degrees/diplomas prior to the commencement of this Act will be considered as having followed a course of study in the Institute. The Central Government may make orders to remove any difficulties that arise while giving effect to this Act, but such orders must be laid before each House of Parliament. Please note that I've condensed the text into a single paragraph while preserving all key details and trying to maintain coherence.
