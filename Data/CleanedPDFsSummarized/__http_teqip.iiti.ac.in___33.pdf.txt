Academics Course on Atomistic Theory and Application: Active Learning for Technical Education Quality Improvement The Institute of Technology is offering a course on Atomistic Theory and Application, a first-of-its-kind program that provides a single window and platform to comprehend the wide range of behavior of materials, especially carbon and boron nitride based nanomaterials. The course aims to provide students with theoretical and fundamental understanding of atomistic mechanics, working knowledge of property and modeling of materials, and training on the use of open-source simulation tools for quantitative characterization and visualization. The course modules include hands-on training via the use of software tools that will help participants immediately start applying their knowledge of atomistic theory. The target audience is faculty members and researchers from diverse fields of study, with a limited number of registrations available (50). The registration process involves submitting a nomination along with the registration form through email, with no fee for faculty members from the Institute.
