Here is a rewritten version of the provided text in a coherent paragraph format, while preserving key details: The National Scholarship Portal (NSP) is a comprehensive platform for providing scholarships to students. The Scheme Owner Other is responsible for configuring and monitoring their scheme, including verifying the correctness of scheme configuration, eligibility criteria, and beneficiary information. The State Ministry Nodal Officer verifies the application forms and provides timely updates to the student applicants. Central Centrally and State Level Nodal Officers are also involved in the verification process, with the primary role of the Scheme Owner Other being to oversee the overall progress of their scheme. The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEIT) is the overall owner of NSP and oversees its end-to-end functioning, providing administrative support and guidance to all stakeholders. The MEIT also provides approval for important decisions and reviews the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and other key documents. The National Center for National Information Center (NCNIC) serves as the technical agency for NSP, developing and maintaining infrastructure and hardware, configuring schemes as per Scheme Owner Other's requirements, and providing guidance on integration and data sharing with external agencies. The Help Desk provides first-level assistance to students, assisting with registration and application filling, and offering technical support. The call center agency assists with escalating critical issues to the team. All stakeholders agree to act in good faith, adopt reasonable measures to ensure the realization of NSP's objectives, and respect each other's roles and responsibilities. In case of any illegal or unauthorized activity on the portal, the Government may take action against the responsible parties. Any grievances related to validation outcomes should be addressed by nodal agencies, while full disclaimer and immunity from data-related issues are provided.
