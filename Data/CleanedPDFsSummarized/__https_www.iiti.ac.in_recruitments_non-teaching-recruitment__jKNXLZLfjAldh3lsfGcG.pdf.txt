After processing the provided text, I was able to transform it into a coherent paragraph while preserving all key details. Here's the transformed text: "The system call letter for the written exam will be available on the recruitment portal in the login section from March 28, 2025. All eligible candidates are required to appear for the written exam on April 15, 2025. Only those who qualify in this round will proceed to the next step, which is the Skill Test, scheduled tentatively for the last week of May 2025. Candidates must make their own arrangements for food, travel, and accommodation during this period, as these will not be provided on campus. No TA/DA will be available for the selection process. It's essential to regularly visit the Institute's website or contact the Registrar's office for any further updates or information regarding the selection process." Please note that I've tried to maintain the original structure and content of the text, while condensing it into a single paragraph. If you'd like me to make any changes or adjustments, please let me know!
