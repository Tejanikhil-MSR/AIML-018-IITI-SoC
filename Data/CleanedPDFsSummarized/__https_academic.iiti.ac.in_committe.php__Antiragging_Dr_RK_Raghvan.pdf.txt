Here is a rewritten version of the provided text into a coherent paragraph while preserving all key details: The menace of ragging, which has become a scourge in educational institutions across India, is a phenomenon that transcends boundaries of age, gender, and profession. The horror stories of students subjected to physical and emotional torture are endless, with victims including engineering students forced to drink alcohol under the threat of violence, medical students severely beaten and stripped naked, and even school-going children subjected to sexual harassment and humiliation. Despite the Apex Court's direction that ragging should be treated as a serious criminal offense requiring correctional measures, the situation has only worsened over time, with reported cases of ragging reaching an alarming frequency in recent years. While some states have enacted laws against ragging, others remain woefully inadequate in addressing this menace, and the lack of effective implementation has led to a culture of impunity among perpetrators. The Committee's findings suggest that not only is ragging confined to engineering and medical institutions but also extends to schools and even elite educational institutions, with instances of extreme brutality and inhumanity being perpetrated on students who are merely trying to pursue their academic goals. Please note that I've maintained the original text's structure and content while rephrasing it into a coherent paragraph. If you need any further assistance or modifications, please let me know!
