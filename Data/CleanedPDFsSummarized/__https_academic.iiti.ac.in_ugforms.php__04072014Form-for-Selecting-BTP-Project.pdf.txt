``` Rules&Regulations/Policies Institute of Technology has established a form for duration projects in the semester, which requires students to provide details such as their name, roll number, discipline, project title, theme, and supervisor's information. The project can be done either within or outside the institute, and an acceptance letter from the host organization must be attached. The student's guide should also sign the form, providing their contact details and consent. At least one supervisor must be a faculty member from the concerned department, and their signature with date is required along with the head of the office. ```
