After processing the provided text, I was able to transform it into a coherent paragraph while preserving all key details. Here is the result: "Form of Performance Security Guarantee: The contractor hereby undertakes to produce an irrevocable Bank Guarantee for the amount of Rs. 10 as security guarantee from the contractor for compliance with his obligations under the agreement between the parties. This guarantee will remain in full force and effect during the period that would be taken for the performance of the said agreement, and it shall continue to be enforceable till all the conditions of the Government under or by virtue of the said agreement have been fully and properly carried out by the contractor. The Bank hereby undertakes to pay to the Government an amount not exceeding Rs. 10 on demand by the Government, subject to certain conditions and limitations outlined in this guarantee. In addition, a security deposit of Rs. 10 will be paid against water proofing work, which must be submitted within a specified time period as set out in the bond. The contractor is also required to provide modular kitchen with no channel trolley, bevelled edge mirror, towel rail, and pigeon net for balcony, all as per direction of the Engineer-in-Charge." Please note that I have preserved the key details and information from the original text while condensing it into a single paragraph. If you would like me to make any changes or adjustments, please let me know!
