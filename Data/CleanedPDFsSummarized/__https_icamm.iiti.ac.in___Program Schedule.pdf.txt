After processing the provided text, I was able to transform it into a coherent paragraph while preserving all key details. Here is the result: "A vast array of research topics were presented at the conference, including advancements in artificial intelligence, materials science, and mathematics. Speakers discussed optimization techniques for die steel graphite electrical discharge coating, as well as the application of AI in aircraft structural analysis. Other topics included the investigation of local inelastic behavior of two-level hierarchical systems under large plastic deformation, the steady-state analysis of feedback machine repair models with reverse and retention of inventory, and novel mathematical models for temporal effects on cement rheology. Researchers also explored wave propagation phenomena, such as Love waves in nonlocal orthotropic media and piezoelectric coated layers, as well as the behavior of transverse waves in graded magneto-electro-elastic half-spaces. Additionally, speakers discussed the dynamics of lot-based systems, inventory models for goods with exponential demand, and portfolio optimization techniques. The conference also featured poster presentations on topics such as free vibration analysis of porous functionally graded sandwich plates, refined shear deformation theory, and shock wave propagation in non-ideal self-gas in rotating media."
