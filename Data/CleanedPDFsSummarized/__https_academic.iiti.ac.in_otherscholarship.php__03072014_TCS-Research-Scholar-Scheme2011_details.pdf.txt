Academics Research Scholarship Scheme is established to enhance the talent base in research, particularly in Computer Science, by sponsoring up to 40 students per year across universities. The scheme aims to support students with a strong educational background and research interests. Selected students will receive a stipend of ₹18,000 per month for the first two years and ₹20,000 per month for the next two, with an option to extend it to the fifth year under exceptional circumstances. Other benefits include support for attending international conferences, participation in innovation-based projects, and a one-time contingency grant. The scheme is open only to fresh students pursuing their education in Computer Engineering, Computer Science, Information Technology, or related fields.
