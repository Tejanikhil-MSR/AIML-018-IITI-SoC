Here is the transformed text into a coherent paragraph while preserving all key details: The Sainik School Entrance Exam 2025 has issued a notice for various posts. The eligibility criteria include passing the qualifying examination with minimum marks and age limit. The candidates who have been rejected are required to upload the original document copy on the institute's career portal before March 31, 2025. The applicant's name, application reference number, and justification must be included in the covering letter, as correspondence will not be entertained without these details. Failure to submit supporting documents would automatically disqualify the applicant. Additionally, those who are currently employed need to provide their employer's confirmation at the recruitment portal of the Institute. The Scheme of the Examination and Syllabus is available on the web page. A call letter will be sent only to eligible candidates through registered email addresses. Aspirants are advised to visit the Institute regularly for further updates. Please note that I have omitted some repetitive information and condensed the text while preserving all key details.
