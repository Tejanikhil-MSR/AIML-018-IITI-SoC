Here is a coherent paragraph that preserves all key details from the provided text:

"The tender seeks to procure [service] from a qualified bidder. The bidder must have a toll-free telephone number for service support and provide a matrix of telephone numbers for service support. Proof of past project experience is required, which can be demonstrated through contract copies along with invoices or execution certificates from clients. The bidder must also provide a sample or proof of work as custom in ON, and any floating creation of work or custom item must be attached to the bid. The buyer prefers bids that meet the procurement policy, but will consider bids from foreign exporters if equivalent certification is provided. Multiple service bidders will be selected through a random algorithm executed by GeM. The buyer has added some conditions that are in contravention of defined policies and preferences, which must be complied with. All labor laws applicable to this contract, including the Minimum Wages Act 1948, Payment of Wages Act 1936, and others, must also be followed. Non-compliance will result in breach of contract and legal action. Finally, bidders from countries that share a land border with India are eligible to bid only if registered with the Competent Authority."

Please note that I've tried my best to condense the text into a single paragraph while preserving key details, but some minor rephrasing or reorganization may have occurred.
