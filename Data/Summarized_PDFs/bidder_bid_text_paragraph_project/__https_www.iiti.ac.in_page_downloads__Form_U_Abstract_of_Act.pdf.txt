Here is the transformed text into a coherent paragraph while preserving all key details:

The Payment of Gratuity Act governs the payment of gratuities to employees upon their retirement, resignation, or termination. The employer must submit notice to the authority within thirty days of any change in the establishment's name, address, or nature of business. Upon closure of the business, the employer must submit notice at least sixty days prior to the intended closure. Employees may apply for payment of gratuity to the authority if their application is rejected by the employer. The authority will issue a direction within fifteen days of receiving the application. If the employee is not satisfied with the decision, they can appeal to the Regional Labour Commissioner within sixty days. The Authority has the power to summon witnesses, examine them on oath, and discover and produce evidence as in a civil court. The amount of gratuity payable shall not exceed twenty wages. The employer must forfeit the gratuity if the employee's misconduct or negligence causes damage or loss to the establishment. The Act also provides for the recovery of gratuity by the authority if the employer fails to pay it within the stipulated time. Any person who makes a false statement or representation to avoid payment of gratuity shall be punishable with imprisonment or fine. The employer who defaults in complying with any provision of the Act shall also be punishable.
