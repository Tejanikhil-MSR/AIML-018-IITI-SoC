"This is to inform that [Name] has applied for the position [Position]. The applicant has [Number] years of experience in [Field]. However, upon reviewing the application, some discrepancies were found. Firstly, there are issues with the dates on the Experience Letter, where the Issue Date and Final Experience Date mismatch. Secondly, the Vigilance Clearance Certificate from the current employer is not attached. Additionally, there are also missing documents such as the Degree of Graduation, Relevant Experience, and Ex-Serviceman Certificate. Despite these shortcomings, the applicant has attached a No-Experience Certificate. It is recommended that the applicant provides all necessary documents to support their application. No phone will be in this regard."

Please note that I have preserved all key details provided in the text, including dates, certificates, and experience-related information.
