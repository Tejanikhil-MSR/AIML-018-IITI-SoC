Rules&Regulations/Policies
The Institute of Technology has a transport booking form for project funds, which requires applicants to provide their name, designation, department, contact number, and purpose of travel. The form also asks whether the booking is for self or guest, with an option to specify other details. Applicants must certify that the travel was for official purposes and personally satisfied with the declaration, before signing the form.
