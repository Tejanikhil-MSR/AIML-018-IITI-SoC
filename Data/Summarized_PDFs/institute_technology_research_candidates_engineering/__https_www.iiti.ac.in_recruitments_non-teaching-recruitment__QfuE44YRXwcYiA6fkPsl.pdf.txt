Note that due to non-submission of valid caste certificates on or before the date of application, some candidates have been considered under the Unreserved category subject to fulfillment of other criteria. Similarly, some applicants who had applied as ST category have been considered under the Unreserved category subject to fulfillment of other criteria since there was no vacancy in that particular category.
