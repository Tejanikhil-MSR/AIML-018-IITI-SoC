The Institute of Technology has established a thesis oral examination process, which includes filling out the "Report of Thesis Oral Examination" form. The form requires details such as the student's name, roll number, discipline, and date of joining and confirmation to the program. It also involves an open seminar and oral examination, where the candidate presents their thesis work and is judged on its presentation and satisfaction by the thesis supervisor.
