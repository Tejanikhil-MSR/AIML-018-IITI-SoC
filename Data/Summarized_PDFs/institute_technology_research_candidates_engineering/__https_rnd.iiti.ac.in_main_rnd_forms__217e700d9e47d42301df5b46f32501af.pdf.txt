Rules Governing Travel Allowance and Daily Allowance on Tour

In accordance with the guidelines, travel allowance (TA) and daily allowance on tour will be reimbursed based on a self-certified claim. The ceiling for reimbursement of hotel expenses is Rs. 1,000 per day, while the ceiling for accommodation is Rs. 4,200 per day. The system of giving 25% of DA has been done away with, and reimbursement of food while on official tour will be made on a declaration basis within applicable limits.

The travel entitlement matrix provides the following rates: Economy class by air in train (to level 11), First Class chair car by train (above level 14), and Business or Club class by air in train (level 12 and above). In case of road travel, mileage will be reimbursed based on government-approved rates.

For official travel, officers must book their tickets through authorized agents only. Non-official travel expenses cannot be reimbursed unless approved by the concerned ministry department. The time limit for submitting a claim is within one year to sixty days succeeding the date of completion of the journey.

Note that these are abstracted rules for easy reference and understanding, and are subject to the detailed guidelines and revisions made from time to time.
