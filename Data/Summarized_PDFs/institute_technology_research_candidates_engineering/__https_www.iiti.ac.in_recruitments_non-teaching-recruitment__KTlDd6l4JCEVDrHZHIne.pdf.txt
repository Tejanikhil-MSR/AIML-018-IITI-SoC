Here is a coherent paragraph summarizing the provided text:

The applicant must submit the requisite copy of the original document at the career portal of the Institute, with their registered address on or before March 30, 2025. The name and application reference number should be mentioned in the covering letter along with justification. Failure to submit supporting documents would automatically place the applicant in the not considered category. Those who have applied under ST category but were unable to secure a vacancy due to nonexistence of posts will be considered under the Unreserved category subject to fulfillment of other criteria. The Scheme and Syllabus for the examination are available on the Institute's web page, and only eligible applicants will receive a call letter through their registered email address.

Note: I preserved all key details from the original text while condensing it into a single paragraph.
