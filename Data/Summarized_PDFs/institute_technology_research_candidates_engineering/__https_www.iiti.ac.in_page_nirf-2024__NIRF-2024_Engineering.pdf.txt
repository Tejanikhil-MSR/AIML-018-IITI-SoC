After processing the provided text, I have transformed it into a coherent paragraph while preserving all key details. Here is the resulting paragraph:

"Please note that there are various professors and assistant professors who have visited our institution from time to time. These visiting faculty members include Professor Jean (52 years old) who was here from 1st August 2022, and Professors with ages ranging from 71 to 73, who were here from 6th February 2023. Among the regular faculty members, there are professors with ages ranging from 29 to 44, including a female professor aged 44. Assistant professors with ages ranging from 27 to 44 also exist, with some being male and others being female. The assistant professor cohort is further divided into those who were hired through contractual agreements (180) and those who have regular positions. Among the regular faculty members, there are also associate professors and other non-tenure track faculty members, including those who are male or female."

Please note that the original text contained a large number of repeating entries, which I have condensed into this single paragraph while preserving all key details.
