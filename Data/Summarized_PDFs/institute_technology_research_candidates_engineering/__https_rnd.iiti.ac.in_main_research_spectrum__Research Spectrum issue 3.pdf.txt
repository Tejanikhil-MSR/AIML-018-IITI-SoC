The Institute of Technology celebrated its Foundation Day on March 31, 2024. On this occasion, the Office of Research Development organized an expert talk by Prof Kulkarni, titled "Effective Research Application for Dissemination." Prof Kulkarni enlightened the audience about writing effective research proposals and research ethics. Additionally, the Office of Research Development hosted a workshop on "Research Protection and Dissemination" on March 3, 2024. The resource person shared insights on patent drafting and filing, emphasizing the importance of intellectual property protection.

Meanwhile, various research projects were underway across different departments, including:

* Department of Metallurgical Engineering and Science: Enhancing rate performance and specific capacity in Ti-substituted type layered oxide cathodes through structural and electrochemical evolution.
* Department of Mechanical Engineering: Investigating topological large-sized single-walled carbon nanotubes for hydrogen storage using molecular dynamics simulations.
* Department of Physics: Utilizing spectroscopy as a simple yet effective analytical tool to determine energy and temperature-dependent shifts in silicon wafers.

Researchers also explored the theme of translation research, with five translational research projects currently underway. The "Handbook of Translation Research" was launched on this occasion, featuring 120 entries at different levels of readiness.
