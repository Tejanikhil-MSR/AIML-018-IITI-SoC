Each PG course is assigned a 5-6 digit alpha-numeric code with the first three digits representing the discipline code.

1. **School of Engineering:** Offers PG and PhD courses in Electrical Engineering (EE) and Mechanical Engineering (ME). The coding scheme includes thesis and seminar courses for both postgraduate and doctoral levels.
2. **School of HSS:** Provides PG and PhD courses in Philosophy, Economics, English and Foreign Languages, Psychology, and Sociology, with a similar course coding structure to the School of Engineering.
3. **School of Science:** Offers PG and PhD courses but does not have detailed information provided about its course coding scheme.
