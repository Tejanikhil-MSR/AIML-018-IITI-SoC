--- Summary for academic_iiti_ac_in_Guidelines for financial support for attending and presenting research papers in international and national conferences.pdf ---

 IIT Indore offers financial aid to Ph.D., P.G., and U.G. students for attending national or international conferences to present their research papers. The maximum financial aid per student is INR 1,20,000, with a cap of INR 15,000 per national conference. For international conferences, Ph.D./P.G. students must have a published paper in a reputable journal from their work at IIT Indore, while U.G. students need a CPI of 9.5 or a published paper and a CPI of 7.0.

Doctoral Programs students have priority for financial aid, followed by M.Tech., M.S. (Research), and M.Sc. students. A selection committee evaluates the significance of the research paper and the conference's reputation before making recommendations on travel support applications. Financial aid can be provided as an advance to be repaid or on reimbursement of actual expenses.

Students must submit an application with proof of acceptance, after their abstract or paper has been accepted by the conference organizers. The Central Committee, including ADoAA-PG and DPGC Convenors from four Departments, recommends travel grant applications. Financial assistance can cover conference registration fee, air-travel, insurance, and living expenses during the conference duration. If a student is unable to attend after receiving financial assistance, they must refund the amount to the Institute.

Poster presentations will be eligible for financial aid in reputable international conferences from May 24th, 2024, regardless of whether the paper is part of the conference proceedings. After returning from a conference, students have 15 days to settle their financial assistance by providing an orderly list of expenses, supporting documents, and relevant bills, vouchers, and proof of conference attendance through their faculty advisor/Ph.D. Supervisor and the concerned Head to the Finance and Accounts office.
