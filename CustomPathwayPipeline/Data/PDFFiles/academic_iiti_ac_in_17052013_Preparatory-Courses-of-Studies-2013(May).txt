 The Indian Institute of Technology Indore offers a two-semester Preparatory Program for IIT-JEE admitted students, consisting of four courses each in Semesters I and II. The courses cover Preparatory Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics, and English Language.

Semester-I includes: Preparatory Chemistry-I, Preparatory Mathematics-I, Preparatory Physics-I, and Preparatory English Language-I. Semester-II offers: Preparatory Chemistry-II, Preparatory Mathematics-II, Preparatory Physics-II, and Preparatory English Language-II.

Preparatory Chemistry courses cover inorganic chemistry, organic chemistry, physical chemistry, chemical kinetics, thermodynamics, and more. Mathematics focuses on algebra, calculus, statistics, complex numbers, vectors, matrices, determinants, etc. Physics topics include mechanics, electricity, magnetism, optics, modern physics, nuclear physics, etc.

English Language courses aim to improve students' communication skills in English, covering grammar, speech, writing, and listening comprehension. Each course comes with suggested reading lists for further study.

For instance, Preparatory Chemistry-II covers Inorganic Chemistry (d-block elements, crystal field theory, magnetism, valence bond theory, metal-carbonyl chemistry, catalysis, f-block elements), Organic Chemistry (functional group interconversions, stereochemistry, aromaticity, electrophilic/nucleophilic substitution reactions), and Physical Chemistry (quantum mechanics, spectroscopy, alkali metal spectra, dipole moment, intermolecular forces).

Preparatory Mathematics-I focuses on algebra, coordinate geometry, vectors, matrices, determinants, complex numbers, while Preparatory Mathematics-II covers functions, inverse functions, limits, continuity, derivatives, integrals, maxima, minima, etc.

Preparatory Physics-I covers units and dimensions, electricity and magnetism, electrical potential energy, capacitance, electric current, Biot-Savart law, Ampere's law, electromagnetic induction, while Preparatory Physics-II focuses on optics, wave nature of light, modern physics, atomic nucleus, radioactivity, binding energy, fission and fusion processes, photoelectric effect, Bohr's theory, X-rays, Moseley's law.

English Language courses offered are PHS 101 (basic grammar, spoken English skills, report writing, business letters) and PHS 102 (technical communication, listening comprehension, professional writing, speaking skills, soft skills).
