 The provided texts outline the procedures for evaluating and revising Master's Research (MSR) theses at an unnamed institution. Here's a summary:

1. An MSR thesis is evaluated by external examiners, who are Ph.D. holders, professors, or professionals with significant experience in the field. The selection process involves sending the synopsis to potential examiners, and if no suitable candidate is found, new suggestions are requested.

2. Examiners may recommend one of four options for the thesis: satisfactory (A), requires clarification before Oral Examination Board (B), revisions based on suggestions (C), or rejection of the thesis (D). Revisions may also be necessary in cases where a student requests to change their supervisor.

3. In case of recommendation 'C' or 'D', the thesis is revised accordingly and resubmitted for evaluation by the same or different examiners, respectively.

4. The MSR Oral Examination Board consists of a Chairman, an External Examiner, Thesis Supervisor(s), and an Internal Examiner nominated by the Head of Department in consultation with Thesis Supervisor(s). For revised committees, the External Examiner may attend online.

5. The final copy of the MSR thesis, including changes suggested by the Oral Examination Board and a No Dues Certificate (NDC), should be submitted one week before the due date. Upon submission, a provisional certificate can be issued to the MS Research student, marking the completion of the program.

6. Libraries are required to maintain a database accessible to the institute community, and students must submit a soft copy (signed by Oral Examination Board members) of the thesis to both the Central Library and Department Library. Honorarium will be paid to MSR thesis examiners as per specified rates for the evaluation and conduct of oral examinations.
