Here is a coherent paragraph summarizing the text:

The Institute of Technology is seeking applications for various positions, including teaching and non-teaching roles. The application process requires candidates to submit their applications through the institute's online portal, with last date being January 27, 2023. In-service employees must obtain a No Objection Certificate from their present employer before applying. Candidates are advised to carefully fill out the application form and retain a copy for future reference. The selection process will involve written tests and interviews, and shortlisted candidates will be informed individually via email. The institute reserves the right to restrict the number of applicants, relocate selected applicants to other campuses, or cancel the post if necessary. All applications must be submitted through the online portal by registered post or speed post by February 10, 2023.
