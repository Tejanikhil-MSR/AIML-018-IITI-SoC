Here is the transformed text into a coherent paragraph while preserving all key details:

The Institute's Residential Accommodation Allocation Committee has rules and regulations governing the allotment process. Applicants must submit their applications in the prescribed form, providing detailed information about their requirements. The committee reviews these applications to ensure fairness and equity. If an applicant is selected for allotment, they will be notified through a letter of allotment that outlines the terms and conditions of occupation. These include the requirement to use the allocated accommodation solely for residential purposes, not using it as an office, workshop, or place of business. The allottee must also pay fees for water, electricity, and other services as per the Institute's regulations. Additionally, they are expected to surrender the previous quarter by a certain deadline when moving into a new one. The letter of allotment also warns that the Institute reserves the right to cancel an allotment if necessary, without offering an alternate accommodation in such cases. Any disputes or suits arising from these rules and regulations will be resolved through competent jurisdiction within the Municipal area of Greater [City].
