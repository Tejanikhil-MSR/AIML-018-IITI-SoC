The project involves constructing a building with various features. First, thermo-mechanically reinforced concrete will be used for the foundation and plinth level, followed by brickwork with common burnt clay bricks and cement mortar. The superstructure above the plinth level will feature steel work with hot-finished tubes in built-up tubular structures, complete with priming coats of steel primer and welding. Finishing touches will include two or more coats of deluxe surface paint on the walls and ceiling, as well as a 52-thick cement concrete flooring with a hardener topping. The building's exterior will be protected by corrugated sheet roofing with zinc coating, while the interior will feature PVC piping for hot and cold water supply, gunmetal gate valves, and white vitreous china wash basins with brass pillar taps. Additional features include single rigid rainwater pipes, sand-cast iron traps, and chain-link fabric fencing made of wire mesh. Finally, the building's exterior will be painted with synthetic enamel paint to give an even shade.
