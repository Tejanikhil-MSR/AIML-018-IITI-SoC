Rules&Regulations/Policies
The Government of India has revised the applicable rate of interest on House Building Advance for Central Government employees during 2023-24, effective from April 1, 2023, to March 31, 2024. The interest rate will be applicable till further notice. Additionally, the Seventh Central Pay Commission's recommendation on migration of government employees who have already taken a home loan has been noted. According to this, before sanctioning House Building Advance, Heads of Departments must ensure that the home was taken by the government employee entirely for the purpose of construction or purchase of a new house or flat. The advance can be used towards repayment of a bank loan taken for the same purpose. Employees will be eligible for grant of House Building Advance on the date they leave and other financial institutions, regardless of whether they applied for it before raising the loan.
