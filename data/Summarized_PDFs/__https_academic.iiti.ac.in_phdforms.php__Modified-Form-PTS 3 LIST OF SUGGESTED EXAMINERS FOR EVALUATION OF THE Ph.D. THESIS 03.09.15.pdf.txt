Academics
The Institute of Technology has provided a form for evaluating the thesis, requiring students to fill up details such as name, roll number, discipline, and school. The form also seeks consent from faculty members for evaluation, with options to either attach or mail the documents. Additionally, the Dean Academic has signed off on the order of preference for the thesis examiners and chairman of the oral examination board.
