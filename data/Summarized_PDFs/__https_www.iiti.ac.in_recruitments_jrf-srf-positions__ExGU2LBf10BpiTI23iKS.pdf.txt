Academics
The Department of Mechanical Engineering at Institute of Technology invites applications for Junior Research Fellow positions in a research project funded by Armament Research Board. The project aims to develop a numerical model for computing flow and acoustic fields inside and outside gun barrels. Eligible candidates should have a Bachelor's or Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering, Applied Mechanics, Science, or Engineering with first division, or a valid GATE score in any branch of engineering. Desirable qualifications include exposure to Finite Element Method, Computational Fluid Dynamics, and Mechanical Age Limit is preferably below 40. The selected candidate will carry out research on pressure and velocity fields inside and outside gun barrels. The application deadline is November 11, 2025, and interested candidates should submit their applications through Time form along with academic credentials, starting from standard onwards, work experience, and nature of work if applicable.
