Academics
The Institute of Technology has a form evaluation report for awarding research degrees. The report provides feedback from an examiner and recommends one of four options: the thesis is satisfactory, needs minor changes, requires significant revisions, or should be rejected. The report includes space for the examiner to provide detailed comments and suggest areas for improvement.
