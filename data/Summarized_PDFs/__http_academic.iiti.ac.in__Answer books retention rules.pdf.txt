Rules&Regulations/Policies
The Policy of the Institute for retention of answers states that the corrected answers of End semester are to be retained for a period of one academic year. Additionally, the right to access a copy of the corrected answer will not be available beyond this period. The Institute also ensures that the corrected answers of Mid semester and quiz are made available before the declaration of the same, allowing students to refer to them as needed.
