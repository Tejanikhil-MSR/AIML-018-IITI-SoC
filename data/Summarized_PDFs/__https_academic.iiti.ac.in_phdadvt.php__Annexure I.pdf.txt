Here is the transformed text into a coherent paragraph:

The Ministry of Electronics Information Technology has introduced a scheme for institutions to enroll students in research and development projects. The scheme provides a research grant of â‚¹20,000 per year, accommodation support of 30% of the fellowship amount, international conference support, and institutional overhead costs. To be eligible, institutions must submit a proposal outlining the research project's objectives, requirements, and budget. The institution will then procure the necessary equipment and services as outlined in the proposal. The scheme also provides for reimbursement of expenses incurred during international conferences and lab visits. The institution is responsible for submitting annual performance reports for each candidate enrolled under the scheme. In case of non-performance or non-compliance, the institution must intimate the same to the Ministry immediately.
