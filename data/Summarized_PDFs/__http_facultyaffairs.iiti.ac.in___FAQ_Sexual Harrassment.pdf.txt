Rules&Regulations/Policies
The Department of Personnel and Training has established rules for preventing sexual harassment of working women. The Rule of Conduct 1964 prohibits any government servant from indulging in sexual harassment at their workplace. Every government servant is expected to take appropriate measures to prevent such harassment. The rule also outlines the composition of a committee, which should be headed by a woman and include third-party representatives. The committee's inquiry report will serve as a charge sheet, and the disciplinary authority will act upon it accordingly. The procedure for dealing with sexual harassment cases is outlined in Rule 14 of 1965, and the complaint committee is the competent authority to decide the procedure. A copy of the report may be given to the officer complainant, and the aggrieved woman has the option to seek transfer or leave as per the Leave Act 1972.
