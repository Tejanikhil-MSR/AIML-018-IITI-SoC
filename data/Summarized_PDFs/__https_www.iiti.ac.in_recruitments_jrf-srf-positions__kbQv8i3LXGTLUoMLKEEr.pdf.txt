The URA Institute of Technology Department of Civil Engineering is seeking a Junior Research Fellow for a research project titled "The Role of Permeable New Approach Towards Strengthening of Structural Stability Control for Urban and Recharge of Ground Water" funded by the National Research Foundation. The selected candidate will be involved in laboratory, field, and numerical modeling to assess the structural behavior and long-term efficiency of enhanced permeable pavements. The project aims to evaluate the performance, durability, and stability control of these pavement systems in urban flood management and recharge.
