Mostly we are able to cope with these as we go along. Sometimes however we may find that our academics, friends of family are posing odds that we find too complex to deal with creating emotional imbalances and stress. This may be the time when counselling sessions may prove useful and relevant in helping us find solutions to our problems. What kind of help can a student expect from a counsellor? A counsellor is a sounding board, a confidant and an expert at emotional and circumstantial problem solving. Whether a problem comes suddenly as a crises or has been present for a long time, it can be looked into and helped. The counsellor builds a supportive environment and slowly helps a person build inner resources that enable effective coping. Is sharing with a friend the same as sharing with a counsellor? Sharing with friends is both useful and natural. Sometimes sharing is enough and helps automatically. However if after repeated sharing one still feels overwhelmed with one's problems counselling may be a better alternative to seek. Is going to a counsellor a sign of weakness or insanity? Absolutely not. We all need help time and again so that we can be happy and well adjusted. A counsellor functions with this understanding and it helps if the counselee sees the process as normal and useful too. Unnecessary fears and stigma is a sign of lack of information about the counselling process and are best ignored. .

SOCIAL MEDIA FACEBOOK IITI Tweets IITI Tweets by IITIOfficial Instagram IITI A post shared by IIT Indore iitindoreofficial IIT Indore IIT Indore Contact Us Contact Us PUBLIC RELATIONS AND LIASIONING OFFICE Contact Information: Contact Information: Director's Message Director's Message Director's Message I want to thank and congratulate each one of you for your contribution and support to IIT Indore since its inception. I firmly believe that the Institute has certainly carved a niche for itself and is poised to scale even greater heights in the near future. On the research front, I complement IIT Indore for excelling very well. At the same time, I urge you to spare some time to look into the difficulties faced by the country, local people, workers and farmers, the ones at the bottom of the pyramid, especially in and around the city of Indore and the state of Madhya Pradesh, where we are situated. Some of the areas which need R D are health care system, climate change, energy and natural resources management. Most of the problems in this domain are multi disciplinary in nature and require collaborative efforts among the teams of diverse expertise. With our excellent research potential, we have an opportunity to contribute to these causes and make a national impact. As the Institute is located in a geographically advantageous location, I would urge you to look into the possibilities of establishing Industry Academia connectivity consortia approach with the industries in the vicinity to understand their needs and provide technological solutions. At the same time, a similar consortia type approach is needed to collaborate with the country wide industries. On the academic front, National Education Policy 2020 advocates holistic and multidisciplinary education to our students. Offering courses in liberal studies in addition to humanities, social sciences and STEM courses, would help broaden students knowledge further. Also, providing opportunities to pursue joint degrees and minors, and offering open, field and small credit courses, with an academic credit bank, help enhance students interest in academics. Experiential learning approaches like Do It Yourself through Makers Spaces, industrial and rural immersion are necessary to help students broaden their outlook. On the outreach front, we need to establish a network of alumni, corporates and philanthropists, making them partners in the growth of the Institute. Such partnerships not only bring resources but also facilitate new ideas making our education and research more relevant. Engaging experts from diverse fields in advisory roles would benefit various programs in the Institute, through their rich experience and wisdom. In summary, my vision is to create an ambience in the Institute, where thousands blossom and benefit people of India. Wishing you and your family members great health, and success in your every endeavour.

Mostly we are able to cope with these as we go along. Sometimes however we may find that our academics, friends of family are posing odds that we find too complex to deal with creating emotional imbalances and stress. This may be the time when counselling sessions may prove useful and relevant in helping us find solutions to our problems. What kind of help can a student expect from a counsellor? A counsellor is a sounding board, a confidant and an expert at emotional and circumstantial problem solving. Whether a problem comes suddenly as a crises or has been present for a long time, it can be looked into and helped. The counsellor builds a supportive environment and slowly helps a person build inner resources that enable effective coping. Is sharing with a friend the same as sharing with a counsellor? Sharing with friends is both useful and natural. Sometimes sharing is enough and helps automatically. However if after repeated sharing one still feels overwhelmed with one's problems counselling may be a better alternative to seek. Is going to a counsellor a sign of weakness or insanity? Absolutely not. We all need help time and again so that we can be happy and well adjusted. A counsellor functions with this understanding and it helps if the counselee sees the process as normal and useful too. Unnecessary fears and stigma is a sign of lack of information about the counselling process and are best ignored. .

I firmly believe that the Institute has certainly carved a niche for itself and is poised to scale even greater heights in the near future. On the research front, I complement IIT Indore for excelling very well. At the same time, I urge you to spare some time to look into the difficulties faced by the country, local people, workers and farmers, the ones at the bottom of the pyramid, especially in and around the city of Indore and the state of Madhya Pradesh, where we are situated. Some of the areas which need R D are health care system, climate change, energy and natural resources management. Most of the problems in this domain are multi disciplinary in nature and require collaborative efforts among the teams of diverse expertise. With our excellent research potential, we have an opportunity to contribute to these causes and make a national impact. As the Institute is located in a geographically advantageous location, I would urge you to look into the possibilities of establishing Industry Academia connectivity consortia approach with the industries in the vicinity to understand their needs and provide technological solutions. At the same time, a similar consortia type approach is needed to collaborate with the country wide industries. On the academic front, National Education Policy 2020 advocates holistic and multidisciplinary education to our students. Offering courses in liberal studies in addition to humanities, social sciences and STEM courses, would help broaden students knowledge further. Also, providing opportunities to pursue joint degrees and minors, and offering open, field and small credit courses, with an academic credit bank, help enhance students interest in academics. Experiential learning approaches like Do It Yourself through Makers Spaces, industrial and rural immersion are necessary to help students broaden their outlook. On the outreach front, we need to establish a network of alumni, corporates and philanthropists, making them partners in the growth of the Institute. Such partnerships not only bring resources but also facilitate new ideas making our education and research more relevant. Engaging experts from diverse fields in advisory roles would benefit various programs in the Institute, through their rich experience and wisdom. In summary, my vision is to create an ambience in the Institute, where thousands blossom and benefit people of India. Wishing you and your family members great health, and success in your every endeavour.

With a panoply of activities organised under the banner of cultural and technical events, to a multitude of clubs that help the students follow their interests, the students gain an impressive repertoire of skills, apart from academic excellence. Whether it be the performance at inter IITs, at annual TvsMs, or international competitions, the students at IITI have consistently shone with full brilliance. With a close knit community of more than 1800 students, students here form strong and lasting friendships for life. QUICK LINKS Alumni Fluxus NIRF IIT Indore IIT Indore

[./dataset/http_ee.iiti.ac.in_safety_rules.html\text.txt] Discipline of Electrical Engineering EE , IIT Indore. Safety Guidelines for Undergraduate Electrical Labs The power levels and the rotating machines used in Electrical Labs can pose significant hazard to the laboratory users, if not handled properly. The major hazards associated with electricity are electrical shock and fire. Electrical shock occurs when the body becomes part of the electric circuit. In addition to the electrical shock hazards, sparks from electrical equipment can serve as an ignition source for flammable or explosive vapors. Some general guidelines that can be used to reduce the risk of injury caused by laboratory hazards are as follows: Avoid contact with energized electrical circuits. Disconnect the power source before servicing or repairing electrical equipment. When it is necessary to handle equipment that is plugged in, be sure hands are dry and, when possible, wear nonconductive gloves and shoes with insulated soles. If it is not unsafe to do so, work with only one hand, keeping the other hand at your side or in your pocket, away from all conductive material. This precaution reduces the likelihood of accidents that result in current passing through the chest cavity. If water or a chemical is spilled onto equipment, shut off power at the main switch or circuit breaker and unplug the equipment. If an individual comes in contact with a live electrical conductor, do not touch the equipment, cord or person. Disconnect the power source from the circuit breaker or pull out the plug using a leather belt. Do not make circuit changes or perform any wiring when power is on. Do not wear loose fitting clothing or jewelry in the lab. Rings and necklaces are usual excellent conductors in contact with your skin. It is wise in electrical labs to wear pants rather than shorts or skirts. Ties are also dangerous. Powered equipment can be hot! Use caution when handling equipment after it has been operating. Do your wiring, setup, and a careful circuit checkout before applying power. Use wires of appropriate length. Do not allow them to drape over your equipment. Avoid splices, which create live surfaces. When running a pair of wires to adjacent terminals, twist the wires together so they don t dangle. This also neatens your work and will save time. Do not touch anything if your hands are wet. The "one hand" approach is safest. If you can't keep your hand in your pocket, do not touch any metal object with free hand. Do not pull wires out until you are absolutely sure that the circuit is completely dead. Shocks can occur if an inductive load motor or transformer is disconnected while conducting. All the electrical equipment must be connected to the proper earth line. All high voltage equipment must properly be marked and danger signs displayed. Don't depend on switches to de energize a circuit. Pull the plug out from the socket outlet. If you are working on high voltage circuits, have a co worker along with you who knows how to break the circuit to get you free and how to give you mouth to mouth resuscitation and closed chest heart massage. When you are mentally or physically tired, avoid work on energized circuits. High voltage connections must have no sharp points. Permanent or temporary enclosures around high voltage equipment should be used. Safety Guidelines for DIBSD Laboratory You are required to wear protective head, foot, and body coverings to reduce particulate contamination. You must wear the required Personal protective equipment PPE to protect you from the materials and processes that you use. Eye protection such as safety goggles and glasses protect sight in the case of a chemical splash or uncontrolled reaction. Use the appropriate gloves for the chemicals you handle in order to protect your skin. Be familiar with the lab protocols and layout at your facility. DON T use equipment, materials, or processes that you are unfamiliar with; get the proper training first. Locate and understand the proper operation of safety equipment including fire extinguishers, safety showers, eye wash stations, and emergency shut off and bypass switches. Know the facility emergency signals, alarms, and evacuation routes and procedures. Know and follow compressed gas cylinder safety protocols; ensure that you are familiar with hazardous gas monitoring equipment and the associated alarms. Chemical handling, including acids, bases, solvents, carcinogens, and cryogenics, is common in wet labs. Read and understand the material safety data sheets MSDS for the chemicals in the DIBSD lab to provide guidance on use, required PPE, spill procedures and disposal. If you are splashed with a chemical, immediately flush the area with copious quantities of water for 10 to 15 minutes and remove contaminated clothing. Pay special attention to the use of hydrofluoric acid HF because skin or eye contact is extremely dangerous. HF exposures may not cause pain at first, but the fluoride ion continues to burn through your tissue until it causes painful bone destruction. Rinse any suspected skin or eye contact immediately with water, and seek immediate medical attention. Calcium gluconate gel or other treatment methods may be needed, and these should be administered by a qualified medical professional. Always conduct chemical processes under fume hoods or in designated wet benches, if possible. Practice good housekeeping with chemicals: clearly label containers, minimize quantities, and clean up materials after use. Ensure that chemicals are stored in rated chemical cabinets and are separated by hazard class. Know the spill procedures and the location of spill equipment in the cleanroom. Properly dispose of all chemicals, mixtures, and spill cleanup materials as hazardous waste in designated waste streams. Safety Guidelines for Molecular Nanoelectronics Research Group PG 20 The chemicals and power levels used in MNRG Laboratory can pose significant hazard to the laboratory user if not handled carefully properly. The major hazards associated with electricity are electric shock fire. Some General guidelines that can be used to reduce the risk of injury caused by laboratory hazards are as follows: Know all the safety rules and procedures that apply to your work. If you don t understand ask someone. Avoid working alone in the laboratory. Do not eat, drink or smoke in laboratory. Always read Material Safety Data Sheet for chemicals before using them in order to know safety precautions for it. Always wear gloves, laboratory coat shoes while working with hazardous chemicals. Wear goggles and masks while working with those chemicals which are toxic hazardous to eyes. If in any case chemical comes in contact with skin or eyes then immediately rinse it with cold water and take further medical help. Do not pipette or siphon chemicals by mouth. Wash hands with soap before leaving the work area, even if you were wearing gloves. Dispose of hazardous waste only in containers approved for that use. Use laboratory equipment only for its designated purpose. Combine reagents in the appropriate order i.e. pour water first then acid . Carefully handle glass bottles of chemicals which are large in size. Avoid exposures to gases, vapors aerosols USE FUMEHOOD . Immediately report all accidents to the laboratory in charge. Apparatus should be set as far back on the bench as conveniently possible so it ll not tip onto the floor. When it is necessary to handle the equipment that is plugged in, be sure hands are dry and, when possible wear non conductive gloves and shoes with insulated soles. Do not use electrical equipments like dryer, continuously for too long as they may get very hot. Do not touch Physical Vapor Deposition system s compressor while it s on as it is very hot. Use caution when handling equipment after it has been operating. Always remember to turn off UPS of Physical Vapor Deposition system when you shut down the system. Always remember turn off all the appliances from main supply also once your work is done. Do not set up apparatus so that it is necessary to reach through assembly to turn water, gas or electricity on or off. Assemble apparatus so that control valves switches will remain accessible in case of fire. Do not keep oven too close against wall or near other appliances. Disconnect the power source before servicing or repairing electrical equipment. All high voltage equipment must be properly marked and danger signs displayed. Be familiar with emergency procedures exits, evacuation routes, fire extinguisher and first aid kits . LASER Safety Guideline In DIBSD Laboratory Class 3B continuous wave He Cd LASER of wavelength 325nm and maximum power of 200mW is in use for PL spectroscopy system. Before turning on the laser pointer, always be sure that it is pointed away from yourself and others. Never look directly into a laser pointer. Never direct a laser pointer at another person. Watches and other jewelry that might enter the optical plane should not be allowed in the laboratory. All non optical objects that are close to the optical plane should have a matte finish in order to prevent specular reflections. LASER is a light source that can be dangerous to people exposed to it. Even low power lasers can be hazardous to a person's eyesight. The coherence and low divergence of laser light means that it can be focused by the eye into an extremely small spot on the retina, resulting in localized burning and permanent damage in seconds. Certain wavelengths of laser light can cause cataracts or even boiling of the vitreous humor, the fluid in the eyeball. Infrared and ultraviolet lasers are particularly dangerous, since the body's "blink reflex", which can protect an eye from excessively bright light, works only if the light is visible. LASER Classification Lasers are classified by wavelength and maximum output power into the following safety classes: Class 1: Class 1: Class 1: Class 1: Class 1: Class 1: Class 1:

Each and every policy, rule and regulation has been introduced after thorough deliberation, discussion and screening at multiple stages. This webpage provides a handy reference to the rules, regulations and procedures that would be of use to you as a faculty member as teacher, employee and resident of the campus. This webpage should be considered as a guidance and in case of any contradiction, the rules of the Institute prevalent would supersede any rule mentioned here.

I firmly believe that the Institute has certainly carved a niche for itself and is poised to scale even greater heights in the near future. On the research front, I complement IIT Indore for excelling very well. At the same time, I urge you to spare some time to look into the difficulties faced by the country, local people, workers and farmers, the ones at the bottom of the pyramid, especially in and around the city of Indore and the state of Madhya Pradesh, where we are situated. Some of the areas which need R D are health care system, climate change, energy and natural resources management. Most of the problems in this domain are multi disciplinary in nature and require collaborative efforts among the teams of diverse expertise. With our excellent research potential, we have an opportunity to contribute to these causes and make a national impact. As the Institute is located in a geographically advantageous location, I would urge you to look into the possibilities of establishing Industry Academia connectivity consortia approach with the industries in the vicinity to understand their needs and provide technological solutions. At the same time, a similar consortia type approach is needed to collaborate with the country wide industries. On the academic front, National Education Policy 2020 advocates holistic and multidisciplinary education to our students. Offering courses in liberal studies in addition to humanities, social sciences and STEM courses, would help broaden students knowledge further. Also, providing opportunities to pursue joint degrees and minors, and offering open, field and small credit courses, with an academic credit bank, help enhance students interest in academics. Experiential learning approaches like Do It Yourself through Makers Spaces, industrial and rural immersion are necessary to help students broaden their outlook. On the outreach front, we need to establish a network of alumni, corporates and philanthropists, making them partners in the growth of the Institute. Such partnerships not only bring resources but also facilitate new ideas making our education and research more relevant. Engaging experts from diverse fields in advisory roles would benefit various programs in the Institute, through their rich experience and wisdom. In summary, my vision is to create an ambience in the Institute, where thousands blossom and benefit people of India. Wishing you and your family members great health, and success in your every endeavour.

With a panoply of activities organised under the banner of cultural and technical events, to a multitude of clubs that help the students follow their interests, the students gain an impressive repertoire of skills, apart from academic excellence. Whether it be the performance at inter IITs, at annual TvsMs, or international competitions, the students at IITI have consistently shone with full brilliance. With a close knit community of more than 1800 students, students here form strong and lasting friendships for life. QUICK LINKS Alumni Fluxus NIRF IIT Indore IIT Indore
